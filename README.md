# HealthCare_Chatbot_Using-AI
Project for the 4th Semester (Machine Learning using python).

This Healthcare chat bot is developed by SADASHISH KUMAR BHOKTA(SIET) and RAJAS V PRASAD(MS RAMAIAH).
# Description
Health Care Chat-Bot is a Healthcare Domain Chatbot to simulate the predictions of a General Physician.These chatbots use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to make the conversations and engagement feel more human. With the help of NLP, chatbots can understand the context of customer queries and provide them with contextual responses. Chatbots can easily hand over complex queries to humans or live chat agents if they fail to understand. But, with technologies like Docusense, resolving queries can be much easier and faster.
Chatbots are programs built to automatically engage with received messages. Chatbots can be programmed to respond the same way each time, to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords and even to use machine learning to adapt their responses to fit the situation. A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. These bots connect with potential patients visiting the site, helping them discover specialists, booking their appointments, and getting them access to the correct treatment. In any case, the utilization of artificial intelligence in an industry where individualsâ€™ lives could be in question, still starts misgivings in individuals. It brings up issues about whether the task mentioned above ought to be assigned to human staff. This healthcare chatbot system will help hospitals to provide healthcare support online 24 x 7, it answers deep as well as general questions. It also helps to generate leads and automatically delivers the information of leads to sales. By asking the questions in series it helps patients by guiding what exactly he/she is looking for.
